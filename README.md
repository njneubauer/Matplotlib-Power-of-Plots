# Pymaceuticals Analysis
## Background

A study conducted on 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

The analysis of the tumor data was analyzed using the following methods:

## Summary Statistics
* Mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume across all drug regimens

## Bar & Pie Charts
### Bar Chart
* Total number of measurements per drug regimen
### Pie Chart
* Distribution of Male vs Female mice

## Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots
### Drug regimens of interest
